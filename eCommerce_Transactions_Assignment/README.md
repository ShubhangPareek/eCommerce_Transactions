Hereâ€™s how you can prepare your GitHub Repository and the README.md file:

Steps for GitHub Submission
	1.	Organize Your Files
	â€¢	Ensure your project directory follows this structure:

eCommerce_Transactions_Assignment/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Customers.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Products.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Transactions.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FirstName_LastName_Clustering.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md


	2.	Check File Naming
	â€¢	Replace FirstName_LastName with your actual first and last name in all file names.
	3.	Push to GitHub
	â€¢	Initialize a repository and commit all files:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Data Science Assignment"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
git push -u origin main

README.md Template

Hereâ€™s a sample Markdown code for your README.md file:

# eCommerce Transactions Assignment

## Overview
This project involves analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset to derive insights, build predictive models, and segment customers using clustering techniques. The tasks include:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing customer, product, and transaction data.
   - Generating business insights from data trends and visualizations.

2. **Lookalike Model**:
   - Building a model to recommend similar customers based on their purchasing behavior.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Segmenting customers into distinct clusters using K-Means and evaluating cluster quality using Davies-Bouldin Index.
