# eCommerce Transactions Assignment

## Overview
This project involves analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset to derive insights, build predictive models, and segment customers using clustering techniques. The assignment is divided into three tasks:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing customer, product, and transaction data.
   - Generating business insights from data trends and visualizations.
2. **Lookalike Model**:
   - Building a model to recommend similar customers based on their purchasing behavior.
3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Segmenting customers into distinct clusters using K-Means and evaluating cluster quality using Davies-Bouldin Index.

  1. Regional sales distribution shows North America has the highest revenue contribution.
  2. Electronics is the top-selling category, contributing 35% of total sales.
  3. Customer signups increased by 30% in the past year.
  4. The top 5% of customers contribute 50% of total revenue.
  5. Sales spike significantly during the holiday season.
